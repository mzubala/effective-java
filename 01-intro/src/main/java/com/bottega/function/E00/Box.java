 * 2. factory method creating box with an element
 * 3. put - puts a new element into the box, throws IllegalStateException if it's not empty
 * 4. empty - returns an element in the box and makes it empty, throws IllegalStateException if the box is empty
 * 5. isEmpty - returns true if a box is empty
 *
 * No other methods should be defined. Try using TDD when implementing this task.
